## 1. Create a New Issue

- Ensure the issue title is specific and meaningful
- Clearly describe the problem to solve or feature to implement

## 2. Create a New Branch

- Use the command lines automatically generated by Github to create and switch to the new branch
- Typical format:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
  ```
  <!--more-->

## 3. Development

- Work on your new branch
- If anything goes wrong, reset to initial version:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD
  ```

## 4. Save Changes

- Execute these commands in order:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "your commit message"
  git push origin
  ```

### 4.1 Handling Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts:

- First, pull the latest changes from the main branch:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

- Resolve conflicts in your code editor:

  - Look for conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
  - Choose which changes to keep
  - Remove conflict markers

- After resolving conflicts:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
  git push origin
  ```

### 4.2 Using Rebase

Alternative approach using rebase:

- Get the latest changes from main:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin main
  ```

- Start the rebase:

  ```bash
  git rebase origin/main
  ```

- If conflicts occur during rebase:

  - Resolve conflicts in each commit
  - After resolving:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git rebase --continue
    ```
  - If you need to abort the rebase:
    ```bash
    git rebase --abort
    ```

- Force push after successful rebase:
  ```bash
  git push origin --force-with-lease
  ```

## 5. Create a Pull Request

- Create a Pull Request on Github
- Wait for team leader's approval
- Merge into main branch after approval

## 6. Release & Tagging

### 6.1 Creating a Release

- Create a version tag:

  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
  ```

- Push the tag to remote:
  ```bash
  git push origin v1.0.0
  ```

### 6.2 Tag Management

- List all tags:

  ```bash
  git tag
  ```

- View tag details:

  ```bash
  git show v1.0.0
  ```

- Delete local tag:

  ```bash
  git tag -d v1.0.0
  ```

- Delete remote tag:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete v1.0.0
  ```

## 7. Useful Git Commands

### 7.1 Checking Status & History

- Basic Status Commands:

  ```bash
  # Check current status
  git status

  # View commit history
  git log
  git log --oneline    # Compact view
  git log --graph      # Tree view

  # Check differences
  git diff            # Working directory vs staging
  git diff --staged   # Staging vs last commit
  ```

### 7.2 Stashing Changes

- Stash Operations:

  ```bash
  # Save changes temporarily
  git stash

  # List stashes
  git stash list

  # Apply most recent stash
  git stash pop

  # Apply specific stash
  git stash apply stash@{n}
  ```

### 7.3 Branch Management

- Branch Commands:

  ```bash
  # List all branches
  git branch

  # Switch to another branch
  git checkout branch-name
  # or
  git switch branch-name

  # Delete local branch
  git branch -d branch-name

  # Delete remote branch
  git push origin --delete branch-name
  ```

### 7.4 Undoing Changes

- Reset and Revert:

  ```bash
  # Undo last commit (keep changes)
  git reset --soft HEAD^

  # Discard changes in working directory
  git checkout -- file-name

  # Revert a commit
  git revert commit-hash
  ```
